// Adds a listener for a specific interrupt or a range of interrupts. start and end determine the range of interrupts (eg. 0x20 to 0x2f) and callback is a C function that gets called

// Example for an callback:
/*
ir_cpu_state *some_callback(uint32_t interrupt, ir_cpu_state *state)

	// state contains the state of the CPU by the time the interrupt occured.
 
	// You need to return a new CPU state (eg. a stored one), or you can return the current CPU state if you don't need to switch the CPU state
	// If you return NULL and no other interrupt listener "catches" the interrupt, the kernel will panic! However, you should return NULL if your function failed.
	//
	// Keep in mind that there is a responder chain, so there can be multiple listeners for the same interrupt. If you return a new CPU state, no other callbacks will be fired,
	// but your CPU state will be the new state. If you return NULL or the current state, the other callbacks will be also fired, until there is a new CPU state or no other listener that can
	// handle the interrupt!
