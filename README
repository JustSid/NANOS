NANOS is a very simple OS (currently more a Kernel than an OS) for the x86 architecture. The goal is to learn more about low-level programming not to create a "super duper hardcore" OS.

Build:
You need a compiler that can create ELF binaries and GRUB, so the best is to compile everything with a Linux distribution.
Run "complete.sh" from the terminal (do not "cd" to the NANOS folder!), wait until the compiler and GRUB are done. After this easy step, you can boot the generated iso ("NANOS.iso" inside the "Build" folder").

Currently implemented:
- Memory manager
- Interrupt manager
- Multitasking (currently all programs run inside ring 0)
- Some parts of the default C library

Todo:
- Drivers (ATA, USB etc)
- Filesystem (Fat32?)
- A shell
- More things (there is no "finish", as long as I have fun working on this project, I will implement new things).
