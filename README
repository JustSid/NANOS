NANOS is a very simple OS (currently more a Kernel than an OS) for the x86 architecture. The goal is to learn more about low-level programming not to create a "super duper hardcore" OS.

Build:
You need a compiler that can create ELF binaries and GRUB, so the best is to compile everything with a Linux distribution of your choice.
Run "complete.sh" from the terminal (do not "cd" to the NANOS folder!), wait until the compiler (default: GCC) and GRUB are done. After this easy step, you can boot the generated iso ("NANOS.iso" inside the "Build" folder").

Currently implemented:
- Memory manager
- Interrupt manager
- Multitasking
- A simple shell

Todo:
- Drivers (ATA, USB etc)
- Filesystem (Fat32?)
- More things (there is no "finished" state, as long as I have fun working on this project, I will implement new things).
